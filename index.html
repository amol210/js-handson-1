    <h1>Welcome to Javascript</h1> <hr>
 

    1. Add two Numbers: You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers
<h3>
    const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
     return a+b;
    };
    const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
    </h3>

2. Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?

You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.
    <h3>
        const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
            return a<10 && a>b;
              
            };
        </h3>
3. Check the conditons:You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:

if both are divisible by 10 console true.
if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.
<h3>
        const Check = (A, B) => 
        {
            if(A%10===0 && B%10===0){
                return "true";
                }
                else if(A%10===0 || B%10===0){
                return "true";
                }
                else{
                return "false";
            }
            
        };
    </h3>
4. Find the first digit of a 4 digit number: You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.
<h3>
        const First_Digit = (n) => {
            var a=n/1000;
            var b= parseInt(a);
            return b;
          };
        </h3>
5. Find the last digit of a 4 digit number: You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.
<h3>
        const Last_Digit = (n) => {
            var a=n%10;
           var b=parseInt(a);
            return b;
         };
        </h3>
6. Find the remainder: You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as divisor and B as dividend.Your task is find the remainder.
<h3>
        const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
            var rem=b%a;
            return rem;
        };
    </h3>
7. Multipy two Numbers: You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to multiply these two numbers.
<h3>
        const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => {
            var prod=a*b;
            return prod;
        };
    </h3>
8. Marks Calculator: Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as A,B and C (out of 100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average.
<h3>
        const Sum = (A, B, C) => 
        {
            var total= A+B+C;
            return total;
        };

        const Average = (A, B, C) => 
        {
            var percent = (A+B+C)/3;
            return percent;
        };
